                <strong>Overview:</strong> This case study explores the development and execution of a merchandising strategy tailored for a highly engaged user community.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Objectives:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the needs, preferences, and purchasing behaviors of the community.</li>
                    <li>Design and launch a line of merchandise that reflects the community's identity and aligns with the company's branding.</li>
                    <li>Coordinate the RFP process, manage the vendor relationships, and ensure to launch the e-commerce website on time.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Approach:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To better understand the community, I conducted a market research based on the community past activities, online forums, and social media posts.
                        I also conducted an online survey that invited the community to share their thoughts and preferences for the merchandise.The survey gained 100+ responses, 
                        which helped the team to understand what products the coommunity is interested in.</li>
                    <li>By collaborating with the procurement team, we successfully sourced a vendor that could produce the merchandise and build storefront
                        at a competitive price. During the process, I was responsible for drafting the RFP file, organizing questionaire answers, 
                        and rating the scorecard which contributed to the final decision. </li>
                    <li>Considered this is an e-commerce website, I focused on the digital marketing which can direct the traffic and boost the sales. During the 
                        campaign, I created content for 4 channels: blog, social media, email, and forum. I also worked with the IT team to build the website and ensure it is user-friendly and 
                        optimized for SEO. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Results:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>The e-commerce storefront will be launched in Q4, 2025 and a special pop-up event will be held in Q1, 2026.</li>
                </ul>
